   Brief personal reflections on what it means to be a Unitarian Universalist. Speakers describe a welcoming community that honors individuality, reason, spiritual exploration, and living one’s values—without rigid dogma or fear-based beliefs. It’s a pluralistic faith embracing questions, diverse backgrounds, and an openness to both love and reason.

      </div>
      
      <p>
        The Tri-County Unitarian Universalists congregation (Tri-UU) was formed in 1982. Ever since, our vibrant, open-minded, and diverse group continually strives to support and love one another in the pursuit of spiritual growth and social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a current membership of around 100—plus many who participate without formal membership—we welcome full-time and seasonal Florida residents, as well as people of all ages in one of the nation’s most highly concentrated retirement areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are diverse in background and belief. Many have come from traditional Christian backgrounds, some Jewish, and others from other world beliefs and non-beliefs. Unitarian Universalism encourages each of us to search for individual spiritual meaning that comforts and challenges us to become our best selves. Guided by our Values and Covenant, we keep Love at the Center.
      </p>
      <p>
        We draw inspiration from history, nature, science, and our congregational family, and we put our values into action through social justice initiatives and community programs.

  </div>

  <p>
    Each UU congregation independently sets its own rules. Creating the documents by which we govern ourselves is both a spiritual duty and a challenge. We work together to form our unique guidelines.
  </p><br>
  
  <h8>We are progressive and inclusive.</h8>
  <p>
    Guided by covenantal principles such as “the worth and dignity of all,” we draw inspiration from science, history, and all world religions.
  </p>
  
  <h8>We put our values into action.</h8>
  <p>
    On issues like immigration reform, marriage equality, environmental change, and LGBTQIA+ rights, we live out our values every day.
  </p>
  
  <h8>We are diverse in background and belief.</h8>
  <p>
    Whatever you believe about God, or don’t, you will be welcomed here—and challenged to become your best self.
  </p>
  
  <h8>We seek our own spiritual path.</h8>
  <p>
    Our fellowship encourages freedom of belief and the search for advancing truth. We strive to offer a warm, open, and supportive community for those who believe that ethical living is the supreme witness of religion.

    <!-- Replace with your image URL -->
    <img src="https://kenpond.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CHARTRUG.jpg" alt="Values and Covenant">
  </div>

  <p>
    As Unitarian Universalists, we covenant, congregation-to-congregation and through our Association, to support and assist one another in our ministries. We draw from our heritage of freedom, reason, hope, and courage, building on the foundation of love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Love is the power that holds us together and is at the center of our shared values. We are accountable to one another for doing the work of living our shared values through the spiritual discipline of Love.
  </p>

  <p>Inseparable from one another, these shared values are:</p>

  <h8>Interdependence</h8>
  <p>
    We honor the interdependent web of all existence. With reverence for the great web of life and with humility, we acknowledge our place in it.
  </p>
  <p>
    We covenant to protect Earth and all beings from exploitation. We will create and nurture sustainable relationships of care and respect, mutuality and justice. We will work to repair harm and damaged relationships.
  </p>

  <h8>Pluralism</h8>
  <p>
    We celebrate that we are all sacred beings, diverse in culture, experience, and theology.
  </p>
  <p>
    We covenant to learn from one another in our free and responsible search for truth and meaning. We embrace our differences and commonalities with Love, curiosity, and respect.
  </p>

  <h8>Justice</h8>
  <p>
    We work to be diverse multicultural Beloved Communities where all thrive.
  </p>
  <p>
    We covenant to dismantle racism and all forms of systemic oppression. We support the use of inclusive democratic processes to make decisions within our congregations, our Association, and society at large.
  </p>

  <h8>Transformation</h8>
  <p>
    We adapt to the changing world.
  </p>
  <p>
    We covenant to collectively transform and grow spiritually and ethically. Openness to change is fundamental to our Unitarian and Universalist heritages, never complete and never perfect.
  </p>

  <h8>Generosity</h8>
  <p>
    We cultivate a spirit of gratitude and hope.
  </p>
  <p>
    We covenant to freely and compassionately share our faith, presence, and resources. Our generosity connects us to one another in relationships of interdependence and mutuality.
  </p>

  <h8>Equity</h8>
  <p>
    We declare that every person has the right to flourish with inherent dignity and worthiness.
  </p>
  <p>
    We covenant to use our time, wisdom, attention, and money to build and sustain fully accessible and inclusive communities.
  </p>

  <h8>Inspiration</h8>
  <p>
    Direct experiences of transcending mystery and wonder are primary sources of Unitarian Universalist inspiration. These experiences open our hearts, renew our spirits, and transform our lives. We draw upon and are inspired by sacred, secular, and scientific understandings that help us make meaning and live into our values. These sources ground us and sustain us in ordinary, difficult, and joyous times. We respect the histories, contexts, and cultures in which these sources were created and are currently practiced. Grateful for the experiences that move us, aware of the religious ancestries we inherit, and enlivened by the diversity that enriches our faith, we are called to ever deepen and expand our wisdom.
  </p>

  <h8>Inclusion</h8>
  <p>
    Systems of power, privilege, and oppression have traditionally created barriers for persons and groups with particular identities, ages, abilities, and histories. We pledge to replace such barriers with ever-widening circles of solidarity and mutual respect. We strive to be an Association of congregations that truly welcome all persons who share our values. We commit to being an Association of congregations that empowers and enhances everyone’s participation, especially those with historically marginalized identities.
  </p>

  <h8>Freedom of Belief</h8>
  <p>
    Congregational freedom and the individual’s right to conscience are central to our Unitarian Universalist heritage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Congregations may establish statements of purpose, covenants, and bonds of union so long as they do not require that members adhere to a particular creed.

      <p>
        Celebrated voices such as Louisa May Alcott, Ray Bradbury, e. e. cummings, Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, T. S. Eliot, Herman Melville, May Sarton, and Kurt Vonnegut have shaped our cultural heritage. Influential leaders like John Dewey, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Juliet Ward Howe, Arthur Schlesinger, Adlai Stevenson, William Howard Taft, and Daniel Webster also grace our history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unitarian Universalism is a liberal religious tradition that emerged from the consolidation of Unitarianism and Universalism. With roots in Europe and the establishment of the Universalist Church of America in 1793 and the American Unitarian Association in 1825, our faith has evolved significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1961, these traditions united under the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA). Today, over 1000 congregations across the US and around the world continue to champion progressive spirituality and social justice.
